## Implementation Details

### User Authentication Workflow
1. Initial Setup:
   ```python
   # Account Creation Process
   1. User provides email address
   2. System generates 6-character alphanumeric OTP
   3. OTP sent via secure email
   4. User verifies OTP
   5. User creates master password
   6. Password is hashed and stored
   ```

2. Login Process:
   ```python
   # Secure Login Flow
   1. User enters master password
   2. System hashes input password
   3. Hash compared with stored hash
   4. Success/failure feedback provided
   5. Session established on success
   ```

3. Password Reset Process:
   ```python
   # Secure Reset Flow
   1. User initiates forgot password
   2. Email verification required
   3. OTP sent to registered email
   4. OTP verification required
   5. New password creation
   6. Database updated with new hash
   ```

### Encryption Process
```python
# Password Encryption Flow
1. Generate unique Fernet key
2. Convert password to bytes
3. Encrypt using Fernet
4. Store encrypted data in database
```
